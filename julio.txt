I am taking IT1100 not only because it is required for my course, but because it will teach me the basics of linux which I've also wanted to (but never approached) learn. Thank you to Professor Sneddon for making this class so much fun! 
Decided to add another line to mention that this class interests me, and I've had lots of fun learning the concepts of not only linux, but how to navigate through my machine with only a CLI.
